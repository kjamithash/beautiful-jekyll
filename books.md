##### How strongly I recommend it: 7/10

<img style="float: right;" width="140" height="200" src="/img/bookImages/seekingWisdom/cover.jpg">

A great compilation of Buffet and Munger's words of wisdom, and their approach to clear thinking in the context of work, investing and in life. This book reads like information dump. It takes a certain intelligence to be able to read it at all, but if you can follow it, it will change your life. This is the kind of the book, whose knowledge if applied, could give you the highest rewards in the long run.
