Experimenting with the concepts present in the book "Programming Pytorch for Deep Learning" by Ian Pointer. 
I create the following models:
- Create a simple neural network to classify the Fashion MNSIT dataset. 
- Create a convolution neural network to classify the Fashion MNSIT dataset.
- Experiment with transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the CNN model. 
- Using tensorboard to visualize a neural network with Pytorch
