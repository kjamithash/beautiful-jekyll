The book is built around three core themes:
- Curiosity
- Character
- Choice

Curiosity and character provide the foundation for good choices. 
Our call to action is to be curious, build character and make better choices. 

**Curiosity:**
 
 1. **Is there a better question?** 
 2. **Lifelong Learning**
 3. **Listening** 
 4. **Incentives**
 5. **Consider the Context** 
 
**Character:**

 1. **Start by considering the End and the Opposite** 
 2. **Emotional Intelligence** 
 3. **Fear**
 4. **Know Yourself, Be Yourself, Mind Yourself**
 5. **Be Kind to Your Parents**
 6. **Sales, Negotiation and Influence** 
 7. **Adversity**
 8. **Be a True Friend**
 9. **Simplicity**
 
 **Choice:**

 1. **Choosing a Career**
 2. **The Ubiquity of Energy**
 3. **Experiences**
 4. **Where to Live**
 5. **The One for Me**
 6. **Having Children**
 7. **Compound Gratification**
 8. **Thinking**
 9. **Full Circle**
