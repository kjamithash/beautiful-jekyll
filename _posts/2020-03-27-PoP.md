## Curiosity: The Why
 ---
 ---
### 1. **Is there a better question?** 
 ---
#### Staying curious 
Adopt the motto ABC: Always Be Curious. 
Dont be scared to ask questions, just because ego consumes you. 

#### Good questions trump smart answers
A questioning mentality is far more effective than a knowing mentality. 

Good managers ask *how* questions, innovators also ask *why*, *why not*, and *what if* questions.

Eg. How many matches need to be played to determine a winner in a tournament with 32 teams?
Instead of doing the math, you can alternatively consider a different question: 
*How many teams need to lose to produce one winner?*

#### First and Second-Level Thinking
First level thinking focuses on the most visible and immediately obvious answer. 
Second level thinking considers what else might be going on. 

Continually asking ourselves *why* allows us to go beyond first-level thinking. 

#### Questions in Group Settings
Whenever you find yourself in a group forum that is tackling some topic: *Ask a question!*

If we search for better questions, which ultimately leads to better answers, we should be prepared to act on that answer even if it contradicts our world view. 

This is hard for most of us, but it is a hallmark of emotional maturity. 

#### Better Conversations

Edward de Bono wrote a book called *How to be Interesting*, which might be summarised in two words: **Be interested** 

The *why*, *what-if*, and *how* sequence can be the key to interesting conversation, and is far more interesting than complaining about the status quo. 

Good *if* questions stimulate rich debate.

### 2. **Lifelong Learning**
---
By three methods we may learn wisdon:
First, by reflection, which is noblest;
Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
Third, by experience, which is the bitterest. 

The incentive to keep learning is not always obvious to us. 

Stages of competence:
- Ignorance
- Conversational competence
- Operational competence
- Proficiency
- Mastery

Most of us stop at operational competence, and become flatline learners. 
We need to choose lifelong learning over flatline learning.

Choosing lifelong learning is one of the few good choices that can make a big difference in our lives, giving us an enormous advantage when practised over a long period of time. 

Since there isn't enough time to learn everything through direct experience, it is far better to learn from the mistakes of others. 

Reading is the fountain of indirect learning. 

Types of reading:
- Elementary reading - Just recall what the book says.
- Inspectional reading - Get the gist of the general context.
- Analytical reading - We explain what the book means, deliberate and focused form of reading. Underline and make notes. 
- Syntopical reading - Evaluating how the book compares with the others on the same topic. 

Learn how to read for understanding

Know how to test whether you really understand something by demonstrating that you could teach it in simple terms with a clear analogy. 

 ---

### 3. **Listening** 
---
Don't be a crocodile, all mouth and no ears. 
Choose a learning lens over a lecturing lens. 
Be aware of the differences between your culture, history, context, emotional state and that of the others. 
To truely listen to others is a gift to them. Give it with courtesy and humility. 

Suggestions for better communication with others:
- Make the learning lens your default setting
- Make them a star - This is not false flattery
- Be courteous - No need for rudeness; Leave out unconstructive criticism. 
- Double check your gut feelings - Don't let first impressions trigger subconscious negative emotions. 
- Find your words - Choose your words carefully
- Words are never enough - Tone and demeanour should be consistent with your words. 
- Know when to give or accept an apology - A genuine apology, offered sincerely and accepted, is one of the most emotionally mature human interactions.  

 ---
### 4. **Incentives**
---
*The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life, while the fox is only running for his dinner*

Incentives matter greatly - underestimate them at your own peril. 
People will navigate the shortest path to the incentive. 

#### The Distorting Power of Incentives (or the "Pointed Carrot")
We get into trouble when we fail to recognise that incentives can overlz focus our behaviour. 
Eg. Imagine a game of football where the first goal scorer took all the spoils. There would be one hell of a scramble to score the first goal. The carrot is effective, but it is too pointed.

#### Perverse Incentives
Understanding incentives is linked to second-level thinking. 
Eg. Incentives for finding a dead snake in Delhi, led to more breeding of snakes. 

#### Incentives are not just monetary
There is much more than money. 
Money cheapened the nature of a charitable act of blood donation. 

What many of us really want is the have pride in what we do, and to treat our work as our craft. "The canvan on which to sign our own work"

 ---
### 5. **Consider the Context** 
---
Always consider the context (Point of view) and recognize that:
- it is different for everyone
- it changes over time

Don't be dogmatic. 

Dealing with context dependency:
- Always consider whether there is a better question.
- Consider what might be missing. 
- For important decisions dont think twice, think thrice. 
- Use checklists. 
- Develop your won decision makin frameworks and keep decision journals. 
- Think like a scientist, and focus on the empirical and measurable evidence. 
- Consult others who have real and relevant experience. 
- Widen the diversity of your won experience. 

Avoid usage of words "I know" and "I believe". Instead use "In my experience of similar situations, I have frequently found ..."

## Character: The Who
---
---
### 1. **Start by considering the End and the Opposite** 

#### Consider the End

To build a foundation of good character on which we can make good choices, we need to look forward. Start bz considering the end. Why are we here, and what do we hope to achieve? What makes a fulfilling life?
 
#### Consider the Opposite

Some insight may be found by posing the opposite question: What might an unfulfilled life look like? Or, what would a truly wasted life look like?

This method is called Inversion. 

#### Inversion 

To get more clarity in a decision making process, try the folloing thought process:
1. What am I hoping to achieve? Look beyond the surface level. What am I really looking to achieve?
2. What does achievement look like to me? Express it in as much detail as possible. 
3. What behaviour or actions would ensure that I failed?
4. What actions do I need to take to get to where I want to go (guided by avoiding the behaviours and actions in step 3)?

Ray Dalio's principles for a life well lived:
1. Knowing what you want
2. Knowing what's true
3. Knowing what you need to do
4. Doing it

### 2. **Emotional Intelligence** 

List of traits for greater emotional intelligence:

1. *Acceptance* - We cant change what has alreay happened, but we can choose our reaction. Serenity prayer: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Egs. Nelson Mandela and Victor Frankl. 
 
2. *Awareness* - People with high EQ tend to have a good feel for what is going on around them. 

3. *Character* - Build character through integrity and authenticity. To be of strong character is one of the highest compliments. 

4. *Communication* - Good communicators are perceptive and tactful

5. *Compassion* - Encourage compassion, rather than empathy. A mother is compassionate to a child, where as a doctor shows empathy towards a patient.
Compassion - positive; Empathy - negative; 

6. *Equanimity* - Calmness of mind or temper. Stay in control. 

7. *Honesty* - Be honest with yourself as well as others. 

8. *Interdependence* - Learning and accepting help from others creates value far beyond our own individual capabilities. 

9. *Patience* - The ability in young children to delay gratification is a strong indicator of success in later life. 
"If you want to achieve anything in life all you need is a clock on the leaning tower of Pisa" - the time and the inclination. 
 
10. *Perspective* - People with high EQ are awake to different perspectives and possibilities. 

11. *Resilience* - Resilience or grit gives us the capacity to treat setbacks as part of the forward journey. It takes discipline and persistence to grow in the world. Flexibility is an important component of resilience. 
 
12. *Sociability* - Emotionally intelligent people know how to both make and keep friends. Introverts are just as sociable as extroverts, they just prefer to be sociable in smaller groups. Being loud and abrasive is not sociable. It is the opposite. 
---
### 3. **Fear**

Fear is closely associated with anticipated loss. 
Change always brings the possibility of loss. 
We worry that we are losing out as compared to a present or perceived state. 
Future fears melt away when we fullly accept ourselves as we are. If we drop our comparisons, our attachments and our demands we can then be free of fear. 

Loss is as natural as birth. In recognising and accepting the impermanence of all things we choose awareness over attachment, flow over resistance. Humans have extraordinary capacity to adjust to circumstances, and we bounch back from difficulties far more easilz than we think we will. 

Cast away the anchor of fear, leave the harbour of regret and let the winds of curiosity take us forth. 

---
### 4. **Know Yourself, Be Yourself, Mind Yourself**

#### Know Yourself
Our quality of life is heavily influence by the quality of our choices. Knowing ourselves allows for more productive choices. 

How do we get to know ourselves? Examining and reflecting on our feelings is one way. When someone makes us angry, sad, annoyed, bitter, jealous or joyful - our feelins are always about us rather than about the other person. Examined feelings are a treasure trove of personal understanding. 

#### Be Yourself

- You are a unique being; cherish your individuality. 
- No one is wathing and monitoring you, atleast not to the degree that you might think. 
- Not everybody will like you, and that's fine. 

Having personal goals and values, aid in being ourselves. 

*There is a crack in everthing, That's how the light gets in.*

Let the light in and be happy with who is revealed. 

Don't fear being called an eccentric. Eccentrics have lower levels of stress and are more healthy, since they do not care about what people say. They demonstrate higher levels of curiosity, humour and creativity. 

#### Mind Yourself

Well-being comes in two parts. Physical and Mental. 

Physical well-being is a right combination of nutrition, sleep and exercise. 
Mental well-being is more complex. 

Difficult upbringings make us more susceptible to mental anxiety later in life, so it may be out of our control to prevent. 

To reduce the risk of mental anxiety the following may be helpful:

1. Pursue a purpose. Live, Love, Learn and Leave a Legacy. 
2. Aim for a balance between work and play. 
3. Rest. Take tme out and switch off teh noisy mental chatter. 
4. Practise accepting what is. 
5. Stand up for youself. You have the basic right to be treated with respect and dignity. 
6. Believe in something bigger than youself. 

---
### 5. **Be Kind to Your Parents**

Kindness is not just for strangers. Show appreciation, spend time together and make small gestures of kindness towards parents. 

*Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. - Plato*

---
### 6. **Sales, Negotiation and Influence** 

#### The science of selling
1. Friends - Sales is about making friends with people on the ground. Face to Face interaction is important. 
2. Fish - Where is the best place to fish? Where the fish are. Similarly, if you are going to sell, you may as well spend your time with those who are mos likely to want to buy. 
3. Fearless -The best salespeople see rejection as a way to learn, improve and work towards mastery of their profession. 
4. Frank - To make an honest sale you need to believe in youself, and you need to believe in your product or service. 

#### Negotiation

10 traits of successful negotiation

1. Successful negotiators prepare.
2. Successful negotiators seek bigger pies, not bigger slices. Collaborate, don't compete. 
3. Successful negotiators take their time. 
4. Successful negotiators focus on understanding the underlying interests of both parties. 
5. Successful negotiators understand perception. 
6. Successful negotiators maximise, but never oversue, their perceived power. 
7. Successful negotiators rarely ever accept the first offer. 
8. Successful negotiators believe that virtually everything is negotiable. 
9. Successful negotiators delve into differences. 
10. Successful negotiators incrementally and continually build on common ground. 

#### Influence

Cialdini's six principles of influence in *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion*

1. Reciprocation - If you want to receive, give first. 
2. Scarcity - People want what's scarce. Eg. Limited editions.
3. Social Proof or Consensus - People do things if other people are doing them. "If it's good for them, it must be good for us". 
4. Authority - People have a psychological tendency to respect authority.  
5. Consistency - Being inconsistent is considered undesirable. Avoid inconsistency. 
6. Liking - If you want to increase your influence with someone else, strengthen your friendship with them.

Good character = Principled sellers = Natural ability + Science + Integrity
