## Curiosity: The Why
---
---
 ### 1. **Is there a better question?** 
---
#### Staying curious 
Adopt the motto ABC: Always Be Curious. 
Dont be scared to ask questions, just because ego consumes you. 

#### Good questions trump smart answers
A questioning mentality is far more effective than a knowing mentality. 

Good managers ask *how* questions, innovators also ask *why*, *why not*, and *what if* questions.

Eg. How many matches need to be played to determine a winner in a tournament with 32 teams?
Instead of doing the math, you can alternatively consider a different question: 
*How many teams need to lose to produce one winner?*

#### First and Second-Level Thinking
First level thinking focuses on the most visible and immediately obvious answer. 
Second level thinking considers what else might be going on. 

Continually asking ourselves *why* allows us to go beyond first-level thinking. 

#### Questions in Group Settings
Whenever you find yourself in a group forum that is tackling some topic: *Ask a question!*

If we search for better questions, which ultimately leads to better answers, we should be prepared to act on that answer even if it contradicts our world view. 

This is hard for most of us, but it is a hallmark of emotional maturity. 

#### Better Conversations

Edward de Bono wrote a book called *How to be Interesting*, which might be summarised in two words: **Be interested** 

The *why*, *what-if*, and *how* sequence can be the key to interesting conversation, and is far more interesting than complaining about the status quo. 

Good *if* questions stimulate rich debate.

### 2. **Lifelong Learning**
---
By three methods we may learn wisdon:
First, by reflection, which is noblest;
Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
Third, by experience, which is the bitterest. 

The incentive to keep learning is not always obvious to us. 

Stages of competence:
- Ignorance
- Conversational competence
- Operational competence
- Proficiency
- Mastery

Most of us stop at operational competence, and become flatline learners. 
We need to choose lifelong learning over flatline learning.

Choosing lifelong learning is one of the few good choices that can make a big difference in our lives, giving us an enormous advantage when practised over a long period of time. 

Since there isn't enough time to learn everything through direct experience, it is far better to learn from the mistakes of others. 

Reading is the fountain of indirect learning. 

Types of reading:
- Elementary reading - Just recall what the book says.
- Inspectional reading - Get the gist of the general context.
- Analytical reading - We explain what the book means, deliberate and focused form of reading. Underline and make notes. 
- Syntopical reading - Evaluating how the book compares with the others on the same topic. 

Learn how to read for understanding

Know how to test whether you really understand something by demonstrating that you could teach it in simple terms with a clear analogy.

### 3. **Listening** 
---
Don't be a crocodile, all mouth and no ears. 
Choose a learning lens over a lecturing lens. 
Be aware of the differences between your culture, history, context, emotional state and that of the others. 
To truely listen to others is a gift to them. Give it with courtesy and humility. 

Suggestions for better communication with others:
- Make the learning lens your default setting
- Make them a star - This is not false flattery
- Be courteous - No need for rudeness; Leave out unconstructive criticism. 
- Double check your gut feelings - Don't let first impressions trigger subconscious negative emotions. 
- Find your words - Choose your words carefully
- Words are never enough - Tone and demeanour should be consistent with your words. 
- Know when to give or accept an apology - A genuine apology, offered sincerely and accepted, is one of the most emotionally mature human interactions.

### 4. **Incentives**
---
*The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life, while the fox is only running for his dinner*

Incentives matter greatly - underestimate them at your own peril. 
People will navigate the shortest path to the incentive. 

#### The Distorting Power of Incentives (or the "Pointed Carrot")
We get into trouble when we fail to recognise that incentives can overlz focus our behaviour. 
Eg. Imagine a game of football where the first goal scorer took all the spoils. There would be one hell of a scramble to score the first goal. The carrot is effective, but it is too pointed.

#### Perverse Incentives
Understanding incentives is linked to second-level thinking. 
Eg. Incentives for finding a dead snake in Delhi, led to more breeding of snakes. 

#### Incentives are not just monetary
There is much more than money. 
Money cheapened the nature of a charitable act of blood donation. 

What many of us really want is the have pride in what we do, and to treat our work as our craft. "The canvan on which to sign our own work"

 ---
### 5. **Consider the Context** 
---
Always consider the context (Point of view) and recognize that:
- it is different for everyone
- it changes over time

Don't be dogmatic. 

Dealing with context dependency:
- Always consider whether there is a better question.
- Consider what might be missing. 
- For important decisions dont think twice, think thrice. 
- Use checklists. 
- Develop your won decision makin frameworks and keep decision journals. 
- Think like a scientist, and focus on the empirical and measurable evidence. 
- Consult others who have real and relevant experience. 
- Widen the diversity of your won experience. 

Avoid usage of words "I know" and "I believe". Instead use "In my experience of similar situations, I have frequently found ..."
