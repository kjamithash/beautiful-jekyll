 5. **Consider the Context** 
 
**Character:**

 1. **Start by considering the End and the Opposite** 
 2. **Emotional Intelligence** 
 3. **Fear**
 4. **Know Yourself, Be Yourself, Mind Yourself**
 5. **Be Kind to Your Parents**
 6. **Sales, Negotiation and Influence** 
 7. **Adversity**
 8. **Be a True Friend**
 9. **Simplicity**
 
 **Choice:**

 1. **Choosing a Career**

## Curiosity: The Why
---
---
 ### 1. **Is there a better question?** 
---
#### Staying curious 
Adopt the motto ABC: Always Be Curious. 
Dont be scared to ask questions, just because ego consumes you. 

#### Good questions trump smart answers
A questioning mentality is far more effective than a knowing mentality. 

Good managers ask *how* questions, innovators also ask *why*, *why not*, and *what if* questions.

Eg. How many matches need to be played to determine a winner in a tournament with 32 teams?
Instead of doing the math, you can alternatively consider a different question: 
***How many teams need to lose to produce one winner?***

#### First and Second-Level Thinking
First level thinking focuses on the most visible and immediately obvious answer. 
Second level thinking considers what else might be going on. 

Continually asking ourselves ***why*** allows us to go beyond first-level thinking. 

#### Questions in Group Settings
Whenever you find yourself in a group forum that is tackling some topic: ***Ask a question!***

If we search for better questions, which ultimately leads to better answers, we should be prepared to act on that answer even if it contradicts our world view. 

This is hard for most of us, but it is a hallmark of emotional maturity. 

#### Better Conversations

Edward de Bono wrote a book called *How to be Interesting*, which might be summarised in two words: **Be interested** 

The ***why***, ***what-if***, and ***how*** sequence can be the key to interesting conversation, and is far more interesting than complaining about the status quo. 

Good ***if*** questions stimulate rich debate.

### 2. **Lifelong Learning**
---
By three methods we may learn wisdon:
First, by reflection, which is noblest;
Second, by imitation, which is easiest;
Third, by experience, which is the bitterest. 

The incentive to keep learning is not always obvious to us. 

Stages of competence:
- Ignorance
- Conversational competence
- Operational competence
- Proficiency
- Mastery

Most of us stop at operational competence, and become flatline learners. 
We need to choose lifelong learning over flatline learning.

Choosing lifelong learning is one of the few good choices that can make a big difference in our lives, giving us an enormous advantage when practised over a long period of time. 

Since there isn't enough time to learn everything through direct experience, it is far better to learn from the mistakes of others. 

Reading is the fountain of indirect learning. 

Types of reading:
- Elementary reading - Just recall what the book says.
- Inspectional reading - Get the gist of the general context.
- Analytical reading - We explain what the book means, deliberate and focused form of reading. Underline and make notes. 
- Syntopical reading - Evaluating how the book compares with the others on the same topic. 

Learn how to read for understanding

Know how to test whether you really understand something by demonstrating that you could teach it in simple terms with a clear analogy.
