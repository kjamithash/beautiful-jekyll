 #### General Thinking Concepts: 
 
 1. **The Map is not the Territory** - Reality check
 2. **Circle of Competence** - What you know and don't know
 3. **First Principles Thinking** - Go back to basics
 4. **Thought Experiment** - Imagine the possibilities
 5. **Second-Order Thinking** - What happens next? 
 6. **Probabilistic Thinking** - What are the chances?
 7. **Inversion** - Change your perspective
 8. **Occam’s Razor** - Keep it simple
 9. **Hanlon’s Razor** - Dont assume the worst
 
 #### Supporting Ideas:

 1. **Falsifiability** 
 2. **Necessity and Sufficiency** 
 3. **Causation vs. Correlation Acknowledgements**

### 1. The Map is not the Territory 
**Reality check**

- Maps can be anything: From travelling to a new city, to becoming a parent. Stereotypes are also maps. 
- Maps help us navigate that terrain. But we sould update them based on our won experiences in the territory. 
- Reality is the ultimate update. 
- What worked then, wouldn't or shouldn't work now

Eg. Netownian physics map which Einstein changed. 

*The tragedy of commons* : What is common to many is taken care the least
