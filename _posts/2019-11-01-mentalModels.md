**General Thinking Concepts:**
 
 1. **The Map is not the Territory** - Reality check
 2. **Circle of Competence** - What you know and don't know
 3. **First Principles Thinking** - Go back to basics
 4. **Thought Experiment** - Imagine the possibilities
 5. **Second-Order Thinking** - What happens next? 
 6. **Probabilistic Thinking** - What are the chances?
 7. **Inversion** - Change your perspective
 8. **Occam’s Razor** - Keep it simple
 9. **Hanlon’s Razor** - Dont assume the worst
 
**Supporting Ideas:**

 1. **Falsifiability** 
 2. **Necessity and Sufficiency** 
 3. **Causation vs. Correlation**

**1. The Map is not the Territory** 
### Reality check

- Maps can be anything: From travelling to a new city, to becoming a parent. Stereotypes are also maps. 
- Maps help us navigate that terrain. But we sould update them based on our own experiences in the territory. 
- Reality is the ultimate update. 
- What worked then, wouldn't or shouldn't work now

Eg. Netownian physics map which Einstein changed. 

*The tragedy of commons* : What is common to many is taken care the least

**2. Circle of Competence** 
### What you know and don't know

How to maintain Circle of Competence? 
  
-  The world is dynamic, knowledge gets updated, and so too must our circle. 
-  Curiosity, Deisre to Learn, Monitoring and Feedback. 
-  Get a COACH!!

How to operate outside Circle of Competence? 
  
-  Learn atelast the basics, while acknowldeging your are a stranger and not a lifer. 
-  Talk to someone whose Circle of Competence in that field is strong. 

Eg. Sherpas in the Himalayas has their CoC in hiking the Himalayas; Queen Elizabeth I make a council of advisors.  

**3. First Principles Thinking**
### Go back to basics

Tool to seperate facts and assumptions. 

There may be a million methods, but only a few principles. 

Understand principles to successfully select your won methods. 

2 techniques:
- Socrates Questioning
- 5 Why's
  - If this results in a statement, it is the first principle. 
  - If this results in "it just is", it is based on popular opinion

To imporve something, we need to understand why it is successsful or not. 
Even incremental improvement is not possible if we dont identify the first principles. 

**4. Thought Experiment** 
### Imagine the possibilities

**5. Second-Order Thinking**
### What happens next? 

**6. Probabilistic Thinking**
### What are the chances?

**7. Inversion**
### Change your perspective

**8. Occam’s Razor**
### Keep it simple

**9.  Hanlon’s Razor** 
### Dont assume the worst


**Falsifiability** 

If a theory cannot be proven false, because there is no way of testing them, then the best we can do is trying to determine the probability of being true. 

**Necessity and Sufficiency** 

Necessary conditions for success ~= Sufficient conditions for success

**Causation vs. Correlation**

We notice 2 things happening at the same time (corelation) and mistakingly conclude that one causes the other (causation).
