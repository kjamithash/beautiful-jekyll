## PART THREE - THE PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS OF MISJUDGMENTS
---
---
### 1. **Systems thinking** 
---
* *Wanted & unwanted consequences* - Failing to consider that actions have both intended and unintended consequences. Includes failing to consider secondary and higher order consequences and inevitable implications.

    - By solving one problem, we generate another one and sometimes create an even worse one.

* *The whole system* - Failing to consider the whole system in which actions and reactions take place, the important factors that make up the system, their relationships and effects of changes on system outcome.

    - Try to optimize the whole and not a system's individual parts.

* *Reactions of others* - Failing to consider the likely reactions of others - what is best to do may depend on what others do.

* *The winner's curse* - Failing to consider the implications of winning a bid - overestimating value and paying too much.

    - Auction: What you won was the right to pay more for something than everyone else thought it was worth.

    - The other party is most likely to accept our offer when it is least favorable to us.

* *Predictions* - Overestimating predictive ability or using unknowable factors in making predictions.

    - Nobody can forecast interest or currency rates, the GDP, turning points in the economy, the stock market, etc. Massive amounts of information don't help.

### 2. **Scale and limits** 
---
* *Scale of size and time* - Failing to consider that changes in size or time influence form, function and behavior.

    - Adding $20k to the payroll should be evaluated as a $3M decision, over lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits, and other expenses.

* *Breakpoints, critical thresholds or limits* - Failing to consider breakpoints, critical thresholds or limits

    - Advantage of scale: In some businesses, things cascade toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm - to a winner-take-all situation.

* *Constraints* - Failing to consider constraints - that a system's performance is constrained by its weakest link.

    - Warren Buffett says: "It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."

    - In many business activities a few things can produce much of the value.

Ask: How do we allocate our time, work, attention and money? Can we identify the few things that really matter?
